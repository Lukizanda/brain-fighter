# GameMode System

Round-based game modes share a common scaffold: a state-machine round, a per-player score tracker, a spawn manager, and a mode-specific definition. Each mode plugs into the registry under `src/shared/GameMode/`.

## Current gating (2026-05-13)

Brain Fighter is being repurposed as an educational shooter, so the inherited competitive modes are gated off via `GameConfig.luau`:

- `TEAMS_ENABLED = false` — `TeamDeathmatch` not registered, `TeamService` is a no-op, team UI/nametag colours fall back to neutral.
- `PLAYER_VS_PLAYER_ENABLED = false` — `FFADeathmatch` not registered, player-on-player damage rejected in `applyDamage` and `canPlayerDamageHumanoid`, aim assist ignores other players.

With both flags off the only registered mode is `NoOpMode` (`src/shared/GameMode/Modes/NoOpMode.luau`): a 24-hour idle round with `scoreLimit = math.huge`, no team logic, no win condition. RoundManager enters `Active` once and stays there; GameStateGui's PostRound overlay never fires.

Re-enable by flipping the flags — the FFA / TDM modules are unchanged and re-register automatically. See [[concepts/CombatFeatureGates]] (if added) or the inline comments in `src/shared/Core/GameConfig.luau` and `src/shared/GameMode/Modes/init.luau`.

## Mode resolution

Active mode is read from `workspace:GetAttribute("ActiveGameMode")` (default: `FFADeathmatch`). Each mode exposes:

- `getConfig()` — score limit, round time, respawn time, spawn-tag, etc.
- `onPlayerJoin(player)` — hook for mode-specific player setup (team assignment, etc.)

## Round states

```
Waiting   — < min players, idle
Countdown — start countdown, lock spawns
Active    — gameplay; ScoreTracker accrues
PostRound — winner overlay, auto-restart timer
```

`RoundManager` exposes `RoundStarted` / `RoundEnded` BindableEvents. Note: these are versioned via per-file `.model.json` (the legacy `children`-array format silently failed Rojo sync — see [[concepts/ModelJsonInstances]]).

## Modes

| Mode | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| FFA Deathmatch | Most of plan shipped | First mode; hardened the round/spawn/score scaffolding. Lessons from the TDM build retroactively apply. |
| Team Deathmatch (TDM) | Steps 1–4 shipped | Step 5 tuning + KillFeed UI consumer outstanding. |
| Control Points | Not built | Greybox geometry ready; `CapturePointService` is the next big build. |

## Friendly fire (TDM)

Friendly-fire block lives in `HealthService.applyDamage.process` (not in TeamService) — that way it applies to any damage path uniformly. See [[systems/Health]].

## Respawn handler ordering

In `onPlayerAdded`, `setupCharacter` (which connects `humanoid.Died` → respawn loop and adds the spawn-protection `ForceField`) is defined as a local function and **connected to `CharacterAdded` BEFORE** any `LoadCharacter()` call. Otherwise the very-first character (when team mode triggers an explicit `LoadCharacter` because `CharacterAutoLoads = false`) gets no Died handler and players appear stuck on the respawn screen after their first death. After connecting, `setupCharacter` is also applied to any already-loaded `player.Character` so non-team modes (Roblox auto-loaded) get the handler too. Fixed `dcd312d`.
